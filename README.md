# Using Machine Learning to Reproduce Ergodic Properties of the Chaotic Lorenz Attractor

We employ machine learning (feed forward neural networks and gradient boosted decision trees) to reproduce some statistical properties of chaotic systems.
This notebook reproduces some results from the paper "Using machine learning to replicate chaotic attractors and calculate Lyapunov exponents from data", https://doi.org/10.1063/1.5010300
